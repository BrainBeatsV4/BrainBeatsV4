# BrainBeatsWeb
The repository that houses the entire Web Application for BrainBeats.

https://brainbeats.dev

# Build Instructions
To run the project locally:

- Clone this repository to your computer
- Navigate to the dev branch `git checkout dev`
- Navigate into the scripts sub-directory (from within the root directory) `cd scripts`
- Run `sudo ./startdev.sh`

# Version Control Instructions
The `dev` branch is where all work is done, and once ready for the live website you must make a PR (Pull Request) to the main branch. The main branch is set up to directly work with the domain `brainbeats.dev` in a secure fashion.
